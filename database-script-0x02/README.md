## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- MySQL server running
- Database created (from schema setup)
- Proper user permissions

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Ensure schema is created first:**
   ```bash
   # Run schema creation first
   mysql -u your_username -p airbnb_clone < ../database-script-0x01/schema.sql
   ```

2. **Load the seed data:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p airbnb_clone < seed.sql
   ```

3. **Verify data insertion:**
   ```sql
   USE airbnb_clone;
   
   -- Check record counts
   SELECT 'users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'properties', COUNT(*) FROM properties
   UNION ALL  
   SELECT 'bookings', COUNT(*) FROM bookings
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'payments', COUNT(*) FROM payments
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'messages', COUNT(*) FROM messages
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'reviews', COUNT(*) FROM reviews;
   ```

### **Expected Results**
```
+------------+-------+
| table_name | count |
+------------+-------+
| users      |    13 |
| properties |    10 |
| bookings   |    15 |
| payments   |    12 |
| messages   |    15 |
| reviews    |    12 |
+------------+-------+
```

## üîç **Sample Queries**

### **Find all properties with their hosts:**
```sql
SELECT p.name, p.location, p.price_per_night, 
       CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name) as host_name
FROM properties p
JOIN users u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
ORDER BY p.price_per_night DESC;
```

### **Get booking statistics by status:**
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as booking_count, 
       SUM(total_price) as total_revenue
FROM bookings 
GROUP BY status;
```

### **Find properties with average ratings:**
```sql
SELECT p.name, p.location, 
       ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) as avg_rating,
       COUNT(r.review_id) as review_count
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.location
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

### **Most active users (hosts and guests):**
```sql
SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
       COUNT(DISTINCT p.property_id) as properties_owned,
       COUNT(DISTINCT b.booking_id) as bookings_made
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN properties p ON u.user_id = p.host_id
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id
HAVING properties_owned > 0 OR bookings_made > 0
ORDER BY properties_owned DESC, bookings_made DESC;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Data Dependencies**: This seed data assumes the schema from `database-script-0x01` is already loaded.

2. **UUID Format**: All UUIDs follow the standard format and maintain referential integrity.

3. **Realistic Constraints**: All data respects the database constraints (CHECK constraints, foreign keys, etc.).

4. **Time Consistency**: Booking dates, payment dates, and message timestamps follow logical sequences.

5. **Testing Scenarios**: The data covers various edge cases useful for application testing:
   - Multiple bookings for same property (different dates)
   - Users with dual roles (host and guest)
   - Different payment methods and amounts
   - Various booking statuses and outcomes

## üß™ **Use Cases for Testing**

This seed data enables testing of:

- **User authentication** and role-based access
- **Property search and filtering** by location, price, ratings
- **Booking workflows** for different scenarios
- **Payment processing** with multiple methods
- **Messaging systems** between users
- **Review and rating** functionality
- **Analytics and reporting** features
- **Data validation** and integrity checks

## üîß **Customization**

### **Adding More Data**
To extend the dataset:

1. **More Users**: Add additional INSERT statements following the UUID pattern
2. **More Properties**: Ensure valid `host_id` references
3. **More Bookings**: Use existing `user_id` and `property_id` values
4. **More Reviews**: Only for users who have completed bookings

### **Modifying Existing Data**
- Update email addresses, names, or locations as needed
- Adjust pricing to match your target market
- Modify dates to fit your testing timeline
- Change property descriptions for variety

### **Data Reset**
To clear and reload data:
```sql
-- Clear all data (respects foreign key constraints)
DELETE FROM payments;
DELETE FROM reviews;
DELETE FROM messages;
DELETE FROM bookings;
DELETE FROM properties;
DELETE FROM users;

-- Reload seed data
SOURCE seed.sql;
```

## üìà **Analytics Ready**

This dataset provides rich analytics possibilities:

- **Revenue analysis** by property, host, and time period
- **Booking patterns** and seasonal trends
- **User behavior** analysis
- **Property performance** metrics
- **Review sentiment** and rating correlations
- **Communication frequency** patterns

## üìù **License**

This seed data is part of the ALX Airbnb clone project and follows the same licensing terms as the main project.
