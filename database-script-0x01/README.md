# Database Schema - ALX Airbnb Clone

This directory contains the initial database schema setup for the ALX Airbnb clone project. The schema defines the core tables and relationships needed to support an Airbnb-like platform with user management, property listings, bookings, payments, messaging, and reviews.

## üìã Overview

The `schema.sql` file creates a normalized relational database structure that supports:
- User registration and authentication
- Property listings and management
- Booking system with status tracking
- Payment processing
- User-to-user messaging
- Property reviews and ratings

## üîó Relationships

- **Users ‚Üí Properties**: One-to-many (a user can host multiple properties)
- **Users ‚Üí Bookings**: One-to-many (a user can make multiple bookings)
- **Properties ‚Üí Bookings**: One-to-many (a property can have multiple bookings)
- **Bookings ‚Üí Payments**: One-to-many (a booking can have multiple payments)
- **Users ‚Üí Messages**: Many-to-many (users can send/receive multiple messages)
- **Users ‚Üí Reviews**: One-to-many (a user can write multiple reviews)
- **Properties ‚Üí Reviews**: One-to-many (a property can have multiple reviews)

## üöÄ Usage

### Prerequisites
- MySQL Server (version 5.7 or higher)
- MySQL client or database management tool

### Installation

1. **Connect to your MySQL server:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p
   ```

2. **Create a database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE airbnb_clone;
   USE airbnb_clone;
   ```

3. **Execute the schema script:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p airbnb_clone < schema.sql
   ```

   Or from within MySQL:
   ```sql
   SOURCE /path/to/schema.sql;
   ```

### Verification

After running the schema, you can verify the tables were created successfully:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE users;
DESCRIBE properties;
DESCRIBE bookings;
DESCRIBE payments;
DESCRIBE messages;
DESCRIBE reviews;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **UUID Support**: Ensure your MySQL version supports UUID data type or consider using CHAR(36) for UUID storage.

2. **Indexing**: Primary keys are automatically indexed. Consider adding additional indexes on frequently queried columns like `email`, `host_id`, `property_id`, etc.

3. **Data Integrity**: The schema includes foreign key constraints with CASCADE DELETE to maintain referential integrity.

4. **Security**: Password hashes should be generated using strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, etc.) before storing.

## üîß Customization

You may need to modify the schema based on your specific requirements:

- Adjust VARCHAR lengths based on your data requirements
- Add additional columns for features like property amenities, user preferences, etc.
- Modify the role enum to include more user types (e.g., 'host', 'guest', 'admin')
- Add indexes for performance optimization

## üìù License

This database schema is part of the ALX Airbnb clone project and follows the same licensing terms as the main project.

**Note**: This is the initial schema setup. Additional migrations and updates may be added in future versions of the project.
